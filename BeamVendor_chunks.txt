PROPOSED SOLUTION
Solution Design and Execution Strategy

4.1 Overview Service Architecture
Before jumping into the details of the proposed services, we would like to share our understanding of the USask's pain points and provide an overview of the product features and services we can provide to help address the pain points.

4.1.1 Pain Points & Proposed Solutions
Currently there is no centralized management of AI services and products, therefore staff, faculty, and students subscribe to their own AI tools and services. This approach works however it poses serious risks and can be optimized for the following reasons.
- Compliance risks and governance
- Since there's no centralized governance, the university is running the risk of staff uploading sensitive data such as student PII to the AI service providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
- Data leakage and university data being used by AI providers for model training can pose significant reputational risk to USask.
- Lack of best practices
- There's a lack of best practices and knowledge sharing among faculty and staff and therefore the degree of productivity gain via AI services is not trackable
- There's not a good way of standardizing best practices without proper activity logging and usage insights
- Poor cost optimization
- University staff subscribing to external AI services and submitting reimbursement does not help with cost optimization. There's an imbalance of usage between power users and sporadic users and therefore resulting in huge waste of subscription fees.
- Lack of standardization of workflows
- Teams such as HR, admission, research and content development can all benefit from optimization of common AI workflows
- Building a centralized AI platform can help achieve a more efficient workflow management
- Slow adoption and difficult change management
- To achieve the University management team's strategic vision of AI adoption, training and change management need to be prioritized. Without a centralized management platform, changes will be hard to make.
In this response to the RFP, Beamdata would like to propose the adoption of our AI Hub platform and other services that can help effectively address the above pain points. In Section 4.2 to 4.6, we will propose the services in detail. In this section, we will provide a high-level overview of our AI Hub's capabilities and its relevance to the RFP requirements.
The solution we'd like to propose is a centralized AI Hub platform that helps USask manage the solutions end-to-end from AI infrastructure and framework management, model customization, to applications such as Chat, knowledge base, and workflow, as well as centralized logging, monitoring, analytics, and compliance management. To explain the vision, below is the highlight architecture diagram of Beam Data's AI Hub.

4.2.2 Compliance with Intellectual Property and Privacy Regulations
The AI Hub is developed with security and compliance in mind. It gives the infrastructure and compliance teams the options to decide the type of models to use, where to deploy the models and services, whether to allow file uploading, whether data can be used for model training and customization.
The AI Hub ensures strict compliance with global and regional intellectual property (IP) and privacy regulations throughout the lifecycle of AI infrastructure and GenAI platform delivery. Our commitments include:
- Data Privacy : we will adhere to Canadian data protection regulations such as PIPEDA as well as GDPR. All personal data is processed under the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and data minimization.
- Intellectual Property Protection : apart from the out-of-the-box models, any customized and fine-tuned models and data associated with it will remain the exclusive property of the client. No data or model artifacts will be repurposed for other projects and will not be used for any model training purposes without Usask's consent.
- Data Residency : infrastructure can be deployed on-premise or in a private cloud that resides in the Canadian region with encryption.
- Audit & Reporting : we will deploy DataOps and model observability tools to make sure that data lineage is traceable and usage of data and model is transparent. Privacy impact assessments (PIAs) can be done on a regular basis and we will maintain good documentation for compliance purposes.

4.2.3 Infrastructure Protection
Beamdata is ISO27001 certified and follows data and infrastructure protection best practices.
- Access Control : The AI Hub admin portal has role-based access control (RBAC) and can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure only authorized personnel can access infrastructure resources. For the end users, we have tiered access control and can integrate with USask's authentication servers.
- Encryption : Depending on the infrastructure, data is encrypted both in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256). Secrets, API keys, and credentials are managed via secure vaults.
- Monitoring & Logging : currently deployed in the AWS cloud, the AI Hub has centralized logging and infrastructure monitoring, and anomaly detection to ensure rapid identification and remediation of security incidents.

4.3 Optional Services
Apart from the AI Hub platform which provides a suite of core features such as chat, knowledge base, RAG, and workflow management, Beamdata can also help build customized models and infrastructure.

4.3.1 AI Model Customization
We can support AI models customization in different ways.
- Dynamic model switching
- To decide the best model for a given task, task-specific evaluation dataset needs to be created and constantly updated. Beamdata can help with custom EVAL dataset creation and benchmarking
- The dataset can then be uploaded to the AI Hub for automatic benchmarking and model comparison
- Domain adaptation of LLMs
- Model finetuning requires special skillsets. Beamdata can help different departments build fine-tuned LLMs for domain adaptation.
- We can help fine-tune both LLMs and embeddings.
- Custom RAG tuning and data ingestion
- The AI Hub allows the teams and users to upload and manage documents and knowledge base. However, in some cases the documents may need to be automatically ingested into the AI platform for freshness. In other cases, the problem is more context and requires optimization of document processing and context optimization.
- We can help customize this type of tasks and help set up automation.
- Content conversion
- For educational content, the faculty team may not have the time and expertise to do data integration and conversion. Beamdata can provide services to help convert education content into AI-formats that can be used in the AI platform.

4.3.2 AI Enabling Infrastructure
The AI Hub supports the following AI infrastructure:
- GPU services
- Vector database deployment
- LLM self-hosting and inference
- Governance and guardrails
- Context and memory management
If USask prefers to host their own open-weights LLMs such as Llama, deepseek, or mistral, Beamdata has the ability to do that. We can help deploy a ray-cluster for fast LLM inference and the ray cluster and kuberay can help scale the services easily. The self-hosted LLMs and GPUs can be deployed on-premise via Kubernetes as well.
If the client prefers a given Cloud provider, we can work with the provider's PaaS tools such as Amazon's Bedrock or Azure OpenAI for model hosting.
We have the ability to deploy open-source vector databases such as Milvus on-premise and have production experience with it for other clients in the past. We can also help deploy guardrail tools to make sure AI governance is done based on best practices.
Beamdata also developed its own frameworks for context and memory management and has developed a custom data model for that. This can be integrated easily to enhance the AI Hub.

4.4 Professional Services
Beamdata can provide both strategy consulting and solution delivery services. Here're the professional services we propose for USask.
- Help organize an AI readiness assessment university-wide and provide detailed report which can inform the AI strategies. It also helps gauge interest from the staff that will help inform the next steps for change management.
- Create an AI-literacy e-learning course for USask to help manage change and teach how to use the new tools
- Based on the AI Hub framework, Beam will work with different departments to build custom workflows as POCs. Including the end users in the change process will help increase the chance of success.

4.4.1 AI Consulting Service
Since 2019, Beamdata has provided data & AI consulting and solution delivery services to more than 40 companies. We have partnerships with tech hubs such as Communitech and MaRS Discovery District in Ontario and has been supporting tech startups on project implementations.

4.4.2 AI Workflow Tool Development & Integration
Each university has its own unique workflows when it comes to student admission, HR, operations, course design, and teaching. While Beamdata's AI Hub provides standard workflow automation features, more complex workflows will require customized services. Beamdata has the experience and expertise to help USask turn existing workflows into AI-based automation so the user experience is less impacted by the introduction of new tools.
AND
Converting human workflows into automated Agentic workflows is not only a technical challenge but also a culture challenge. Based on our experience, AI products are not well received when they don't fit into end users' typical workflows. That's why the end user survey and UAT is extremely important in the process. Our consultants can be deployed to work closely with the staff in each department and learn their existing workflows, get their input, and build something that will be liked by the end users. As part of the change management process, we will deliver training to the end users and the training starts from the moment of initial requirement gathering.
